/**
 * For objects that are serializable, you can alternatively use the structuredClone() method to create deep copies. structuredClone() has the advantage of allowing transferable objects in the source to be transferred to the new copy, rather than just cloned. But note that structuredClone() isn't a feature of the JavaScript language itself â€” instead it's a feature of browsers and any other JavaScript runtimes that implement a global object like window. And calling structuredClone() to clone a non-serializable object will fail in the same way that calling JSON.stringify() to serialize it will fail.
